## Purpose
This repository is a map of my introduction to web programming, through Ming Chow's Comp 20 class. It's got some lil labs and some longer assignments.

## Favorite assignment
Of these assignments and labs, my favorite must be the [security](security) assignment.  It's interesting to learn how and on what the web is built, but I didn't quite feel like I had a tactile grip on what was happening until I got to dig under the covers and see how far the code can be pushed.  It was also eye opening to get a quick glimpse of how insecure a lot of the web really is.

## How much have I grown?
A bunch!

## Most important things learned, two examples
One of the things that I am most pleased to say I learned a least a *little* more about is git and Github.  Prior to this term I had very limited experience with git, and that experience had only been confusing and difficult; it's great to now know, if not how exactly git works, how to use it effectively for both solo and team projects.
A second thing that I'm very happy to have learned more about is what all is going on when someone browses pages online, or uses Twitter; what an API is, why documentation can make or break one; how data gets stored and passed around; in short: How the Web Works.

## A topic I'd like to delve deeper into
I would love to get deeper into the world of web security.
